Food Safety is a webapp where the user can search the safety of your food or brand of food product you purchased by reviewing the adverse events and recall enforcements.
It utilizes OpenFDA APIs. 

This project is still a work in progress. It currently shows a pie chart of reactions associated with the product and a table of reasons for recall.
